# Project kickoff: what I need from you

- What kind of story do you want to tell? Slice-of-life, mystery, sci‑fi, romance, horror?
- Tone and target audience?
- Linear story with vibes, or branching with meaningful consequences?
- Any must‑have features?
  - Character expressions
  - Timed choices
  - Save slots
  - Sound design
  - Mobile‑first
- Do you already have assets (backgrounds, portraits, music), or should we source/placehold?

## Current engine capabilities (from your code)

- Title and game flow
  - Title screen with Continue (auto-enabled if a save exists) and Start New Game
  - Persistent saving/loading via localStorage (scene, line index, flags, seen scenes)
- Dialogue system
  - Typewriter text with skip-to-full on click
  - Advance on click or Space/Enter
  - Speaker name injected into the dialogue box
- Scenes and assets
  - Scene model defined in code (Scenes object) with bg, portrait, music, and lines
  - Wipe-left scene transitions
  - Portrait appears after the wipe (nice polish)
- Choices and state
  - Choices overlay with options
  - Flags via set: { … } and branching using next: "sceneId"
  - Lines can compute text from state (functions allowed in text)
- Audio
  - Optional looping BGM per scene
  - Mute toggle (state persisted)
- Dev console (super helpful!)
  - Jump to scenes, skip to end, inspect current engine state
- Structure
  - Fully client-side, easy to deploy as static site

## High-impact directions we can take next

### Content and scripting
- External content: Move Scenes from code to JSON/YAML (or integrate Ink or Yarn Spinner) so writers can iterate without touching JS.
- Content tooling: Add a simple in-browser editor to preview scenes and validate flags/links.

### Narrative and UX polish
- Character system: Multiple expressions, positions (left/center/right), transitions, and lip-flap/eye-blink animations.
- UI upgrades: Theming, custom textbox skins, subtle animations, micro-interactions.
- Backlog/history: Let players open a log of previous lines.
- Auto-forward and text speed controls; “skip seen text” option.

### Choices and systems
- Choice depth: Timed choices, conditional visibility, tooltips, and consequence markers.
- Achievements/flags: Route tracking, endings gallery (CGs/unlockables).
- Variables and scripting: A light DSL for conditions/math/comparisons in content files.

### Audio/visual fidelity
- SFX hooks for text/choices/scene transitions.
- BGM crossfades and per-character voice samples/voiceover mapping.
- Asset preloading and smarter loading strategies to avoid hitches.

### Save and platform features
- Multiple save slots, quick save/load, export/import saves.
- Cloud save support (if hosted with backend later).

### Accessibility and localization
- Localization framework (strings + assets per locale, RTL support).
- Accessibility: High-contrast theme, dyslexic-friendly font option, screen reader labels, captioning.

### Performance and quality
- Mobile-first tuning, responsive layout for phones/tablets.
- Testing scaffolds for script validation (dangling scene refs, unreachable nodes).

If you share the kind of story and experience you want, I’ll propose a concrete roadmap (content structure, asset plan, and the exact features to build first) and then implement it end-to-end.
